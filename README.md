**Disclaimer:** This is a backup copy of the original Google Code repository
(https://code.google.com/p/hopyone) which is bound to disappear sometime in
2016. I don't particularly intend to develop Hopy-ONE, so feel free to fork
this repo and become the new upstream.

## Description

The bio-droid, Hopy-ONE, was created in a laboratory Professor Jonathan Silt
had set up in 2013 to research the F.L.V. (Fast Line Virus), the deadliest
strain of mutating virus in the galaxy. Silt was infected and cryogenically
frozen in 2026. Hopy-ONE's mission was to collect samples of the virus to aid
in the production of a vaccine. The fate of Silt, who waits in cryosleep, and
the fate of the entire universe, rests with Hopy-ONE.

Bio-droid Hopy-ONE must collect samples of the F.L.V. at each level before
moving on to the next. On each level bio-droid may move left/right, stretch
and jump by shrinking and releasing itself. Also bio-droid may shoot in
horizontal plane to eliminate another droids moving and shooting on the level,
and extend tentacles (also morph).
